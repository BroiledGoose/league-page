<p><strong>3 keeper spots each year</strong>
</p>
<p>Keepers cost round of draft pick the player was originally selected minus each year that has passed since that draft pick was made</p>
<p><em>Ex: Draft Antonio Gibson Round 7 2023. You can keep him in the 2024 draft in exchange for your Round 6 pick being removed. If you keep him again in the 2025 draft it will be in exchange for your Round 5 pick being removed, etc.</em>
</p>
<p>Keepers must be selected 2 weeks before the draft</p>
<p>Players added from waivers will cost you their upcoming year ADP according to Sleeper 1 month before draft + 2 rounds to reward you for finding the diamond in the rough</p>
<p><em>Ex: You pick up Kendre Miller week 6 of 2023, you decide you want to keep him for the 2024 draft. His ADP on Sleeper 1 month before draft is a 3rd round pick after a breakout season. To keep him, it will be in exchange for your Round 5 (3 + 2) pick being removed.</em>
</p>
<p>All players not dedicated to your keeper spot will be put back in the draft pool for the upcoming draft</p>
<p>If you have multiple players with the same pick penalty value (ex: they both would cost you a 1st round pick), the pick removed will shift down by 1 round.</p>
<p>The keeper category (waiver/draft) is about how you acquired the player. If you trade for the player you inherit the category of how the person you traded with acquired the player. If you draft, drop, and re-add the player they will count as a waiver, as it’s the most recent acquisition that matters.</p>
<p><em>Ex: If a player is drafted then dropped and you add them to waivers, you will have the chance to keep the player for the waiver category of keeper cost not the draft category</em>

<p><strong>Roster Construction Rules:</strong>
</p>
<p>See sleeper app this info</p>
<p><strong>Scoring Format</strong>
</p>
<p>See sleeper app this info</p>
<p><strong>Waiver Format</strong>
</p>
<p>Daily waivers with $100 FAB budget</p>
<p>This means all waivers go through the bidding process, with players eligible to be added 2 days after being dropped (players with games played&nbsp;</p>
<p>This system is useful because there’s no “first to check wins” type of system as all players go through the overnight waiver process every day</p>
<p><strong>Playoffs</strong>
</p>
<p>6 teams make the playoffs (2 teams get a bye), with playoffs being 1 week for each round (Week 14, 15, 16)</p>
<p><strong>Draft Order</strong>
</p>
<p>Each year draft picks will be randomly assigned</p>
<p>Consolation bracket winner will be able to select their draft position 2 weeks before the draft</p>
<p><strong>Last Pick Punishment</strong>
</p>
<p>Each year the team name and logo for the last place regular season finisher of the prior year will be selected by the first place regular season finisher the prior year</p>
<p><strong>Rule Changes</strong>
</p>
<p>Can be pitched yearly in the off-season, requiring 75% vote for changes made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rule change votes may be vetoed if there’s significant long term advantage/disadvantage given to certain teams (ex: changing amount of keepers)</p>
<p><strong>Pick Trading</strong>
</p>
<p>Before the draft, you can trade any pick for the upcoming year that you own (cannot trade the pick that was a cost for your keeper selection).</p>
